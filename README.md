# LightningTiles - Platform by Andrew Meriwether
For use by TrailheadX Attendees as a Lightning Component template

Yup you guessed it, all the great functionality of Lightning tiles for communities but for your platform, salescloud, servicescloud app. This component allows to define up to 10 image blocks with custom URL's and titles. Looks great and is responsive as well. Great for your profile home page when the standards stuff is too boring to show!
